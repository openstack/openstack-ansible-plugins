    A variable ``post_metal_configuration_hook`` is introduced, which can
    be used to define a hookable playbook which will execute right after
    configuration of metal host in perfromed inside of ``openstack_hosts``
    role.
    This might be a handy for downstream customizations to happen, as
    networkd, mounts, services and kernel modules are already configured
    at this point, but LXC containers are not yet created.
