features:
  - |
    Added variable ``service_update_password`` that will control whether
    password should be updated, which defaults to `False`. This changes
    previous behaviour when service passwords were always updated in
    the keystone on role run.
    Please use this variable whenever you need to update a password for
    the service.
fixes:
  - |
    Different race conditions in services are fixed when keystone password
    is forcefully reseted.
    Closes Bug: `#2023370 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-ansible/+bug/2023370>`_
