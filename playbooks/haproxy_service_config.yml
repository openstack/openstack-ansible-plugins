# Haproxy service configs are stored in service group vars
# (for ex. `glance_haproxy_services` are stored in glance group vars).
# This is because they may refer to other variables in this group that are not
# used only for haproxy(like `glance_backend_ssl`).
# Group haproxy_all does not have access to service group vars by default.
# To solve this, haproxy_all hosts are temporarily added to `service_group`.
# After haproxy is configured, refresh_inventory is triggered to restore the
# original inventory state.
